jPicker is a jQuery plugin for an advanced, Photoshop style color picker. It can be used inline by binding to any block level element, or by popup.

jPicker supports ALL color modes (Hue, Saturation, Brightness, Red, Green, and Blue), and also supports transparency/translucency picking.

Register for callback methods to get information out of the color picker either on commit, on cancel, or even live feedback.
